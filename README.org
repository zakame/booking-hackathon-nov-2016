  - As a traveller, I want to share my itinerary to my followers so they
    can experience my journey!

  - As someone who would like to travel to a specific place but have no
    idea what attractions are there, I want to have something suggest
    places depending on my state (e.g. Facebook feed) so I can best
    enjoy my travel!

  - As someone who has photos of places I want to travel, I'd like to
    have something suggest to me based on these places

  - As someone who would ask about travel, I'd like to have a search box
    to put my question in so I can get answers!

  - As someone attending conferences, I'd like to have suggestions for
    booking + attractions along with my conference registration

* Chosen: conferences + booking
