* The Idea

** As someone attending conferences, I'd like to have suggestions for booking + attractions along with my conference registration 

* The Approach

- Borrow data from codeandtalk.com and integrate Booking API!

* The Implementation


- Backend(s): Python (Django) and Perl (Mojolicious)!
- Frontend: Vanilla JS with Material Design Lite and Google Maps!
- Infra: Docker with Compose for multi-container devops!

* The Result

** B.Confy
